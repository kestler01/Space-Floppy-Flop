# Space-Floppy-Flop
# Project-Planning
My proeject is called "Space Floppy Bird", a recreation of the game Flappy Bird.


I will have to create a function that will create initially a grvaity system for the ship to action "fly."
Also create functions to randomize the blocks to be at different heights from the top of the screen 
as well as the bottom.
I will also create a jump function that will go hand in hand with the function i create for gravity.
## User-Stories
As a user I need to find a background that fits my app
As a user i need to also create or find a spaceship that will participate as our player
As a user I will have to seek specific gravity difficulty
As a player I want to implement a coin system where the player collects hese coins that determines their score

spaceship: (located on the left side)
meteor blocks: (located coming from the right side of the screen)
height & width: (will probably be 32by32 depending on the sizes of the blocks and get itself)
color: (will try and find a picture or draw a spaceship to be used)

function - gameloop
function - detectHit - when coming in contact with the block game over
function - movementHandler - used to allow the spaceship to fly (jump)
